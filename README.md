# GPOscar

## What's this?

GPOscar is a Chrome extension which overlays the GPAs of your professors onto their courses within OSCAR's registration page. All GPAs are retrieved from [critique.gatech.edu](http://critique.gatech.edu)

## How do I get it?

Drag & drop the `GPOscar.crx` file into your extensions page in Chrome. I plan to add this to the Chrome web store soon enough, so you'll also be able to download it from there

## Todo

* Port to site more reliable than [critique.gatech.edu](http://critique.gatech.edu)
	* Maybe fetch GPA from [irp](http://www.irp.gatech.edu/reports/grades_by_collegesmry.php), but it needs to be reverse engineered & it doesn't list GPAs, but rather As/Bs/Cs...
* Better potential error handling
* Unit tests?
* Support for RMP
* Logo for Chrome Extension
